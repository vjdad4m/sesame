# Sesame
---

Sesame is a music identification and fingerprinting program written in python. The most famous implementation of such program is [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/). This project aims to make this technology understandable to anyone reading the source code.

### How does it work?

Sesame identifies songs using [audio fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_fingerprint) created from the [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram). Identification works only if the database contains a given song and the background noise level is low enough to recognize fingerprints.
